    "fruit": "Apple",
    "summary": "The majority of the rootstocks used to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. . The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. . The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4,00010,000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M. sylvestris). . Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. . The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. "
