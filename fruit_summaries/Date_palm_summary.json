    "summary": "Dates have been cultivated in the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years, and there is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in Mehrgarh, a Neolithic civilization in western Pakistan, around 7000 BCE and in eastern Arabia between 5530 and 5320 calBC. . In some areas such as Iraq the pollinator climbs the tree using a special climbing tool that wraps around the tree trunk and the climber's back (called تبلية in Arabic) to keep him attached to the trunk while climbing. citation needed Date fruits are oval-cylindrical, 37 cm (13 in) long, and 23 cm (34114 in) diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. . The place of origin of the date palm is uncertain because of long cultivation. . The ancient Egyptians used the fruits to make date wine and ate dates at harvest. citation needed Evidence of cultivation is continually found throughout later civilizations in the Indus Valley, including the Harappan period from 2600 to 1900 BCE. . To obtain fruit of marketable quality, the bunches of dates must be thinned and bagged or covered before ripening so that the remaining fruits grow larger and are protected from weather and animals, such as birds, that also like to eat them.
