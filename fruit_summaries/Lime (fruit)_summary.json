    "summary": "The difficulty in identifying exactly which species of fruit are called lime in different parts of the English-speaking world (and the same problem applies to synonyms in other European languages) is increased by the botanical complexity of the citrus genus itself, to which the majority of limes belong. . The makrut lime, in particular, was one of the earliest citrus fruits introduced to other parts of the world by humans. . There are several species of citrus trees whose fruits are called limes, including the Key lime (Citrus aurantiifolia), Persian lime, Makrut lime, calamansi limes, finger limes, blood limes, limequats, and desert lime. . The majority of cultivated species are in reality hybrids, produced from the citron (Citrus medica), the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and in particular with many lime varieties, the micrantha (Citrus hystrix var. . In cooking, lime is valued both for the acidity of its juice and the floral aroma of its zest. "
